# Shortest Palindrome

## Problem Description

You are given a string `s`. Your task is to convert `s` into a palindrome by adding characters only in front of it. The goal is to find the **shortest palindrome** possible by performing this transformation.

### Example 1:
- **Input**: `s = "aacecaaa"`
- **Output**: `"aaacecaaa"`

### Example 2:
- **Input**: `s = "abcd"`
- **Output**: `"dcbabcd"`

## Constraints:
- `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters only.
